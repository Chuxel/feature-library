# Chuxel's Dev Container Features Library

*Everything here will change - a lot. Don't depend on any of it for anything you're doing. Good for demos, that's it.*

This repo provides a few [Dev Container Features](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/) I've been playing with and is based on the [Dev Container Features template repository](https://github.com/devcontainers/feature-template) which makes creating a publishing them a breeze.
